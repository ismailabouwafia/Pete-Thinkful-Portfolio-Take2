Pete-Thinkful-Portfolio-Take2

###Description:
A simple web page to apply all the knowledge acquired so far on HTML and CSS

###Motivation:
Bootcamp graded assignment

###What problem does it solve?
Practicing everything we learned

###What did you learn?
HTML and CSS - I had several issues with CSS but i was able to fix them all in "Take 2". Take 3 is for adding some minor comments in the code, creating this read me and one HTML error that was not visible to me (rendering was fine)

###Features:
1. rounded image
2. nave links made with ul element
3. fixed alignment issue with article and section elements

Challenges faced:
1. adding a border around the image
2. adding spaces in the nav links
3. text alignment
4. ul bullets were way too far from the actual list item

###Kudos:
- To the 2 gentlemen who reviewed my code and provided feedback.
